                  <p>Whole bean coffee maintains peak flavor for two to three weeks after roasting.  During that time, the coffee beans release carbon dioxide gas that drives away oxygen and keeps the beans fresh. Once the coffee stops releasing CO2, the beans start to oxidize and stale. Believe us, you can taste the difference!  Order a roast of fresh coffee today and see for yourself.</p>

                  <p>Coffee begins to stale about twenty-five minutes after grinding because the increased surface area allows the CO2 to escape much more quickly. That's why we here at Coffee by the Roast™ encourage all our customers to grind their own coffee immediately before brewing. If you don't have a grinder, though, or wish to give coffee to someone who may not own a grinder, we're happy to grind the coffee for you. You can choose which grinding style you want when ordering the beans.</p>

                  <p>If you'll drink a whole roast (a little over a pound) in two to three weeks, leave your coffee in the polyfoil degassing bag at room temperature. If you want to keep your coffee fresh longer than 3 weeks, freeze it in the original packaging. Freezing will slightly reduce the aroma of your brewed coffee, but will preserve the fresh flavor for up to three months. Whatever you do, please DO NOT refrigerate your coffee. Coffee is like baking soda. It will absorb any odors in your refrigerator resulting in a fresh-smelling 'fridge and strange-tasting coffee.</p>

                  <p>Custom roasted coffee is YOUR coffee, roasted to YOUR order. Coffee by the Roast™ uses micro-roast technology to roast only the coffee you order to the roast level you specify. Each roast is 600 grams of green coffee. After roasting, the coffee weighs between 1 and 1.2 pounds, depending on variety of coffee and roast level. The darker the roast, the lighter the weight. We package the coffee in clear, polyfoil ziploc pouches and ship the coffee to you within 24 hours of roasting..</p>
